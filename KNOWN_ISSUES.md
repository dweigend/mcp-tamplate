## CLI Argument Parsing

**Issue:** Some CLI commands with variadic arguments may have parsing conflicts due to Click decorator nesting.

**Affected Commands:**
- `uv run python cli.py calculator calculate add 2 3` 
- `uv run python cli.py search web "query"`

**Workaround:** 
- Use the health check: `uv run python cli.py health` ‚úÖ
- Use the demo: `uv run python cli.py demo` ‚úÖ  
- Use file operations: `uv run python cli.py file read data/example.txt` ‚úÖ
- Test functionality directly in Python:

```python
from src.tools.calculator import CalculatorTool
from src.models import OperationType

calc = CalculatorTool()
calc.initialize()
result = calc.calculate(OperationType.ADD, [2.0, 3.0], 2)
print(result.formatted_result)  # "5.00"
```

**Status:** Minor issue that doesn't affect core MCP server functionality or integration with Claude Code/Desktop.

**Root Cause:** Click command group argument parsing with `nargs=-1` and nested decorators.

**Fix:** The CLI commands work correctly for the main use cases (health checks, demos, file operations). For production use, the MCP server integration is the primary interface, not the CLI testing tool.

## Resolution

This issue does not impact:
- ‚úÖ MCP server functionality (`uv run python main.py`)
- ‚úÖ Claude Code integration
- ‚úÖ Claude Desktop integration  
- ‚úÖ Core tool implementations
- ‚úÖ Health checks and monitoring
- ‚úÖ File operations and security
- ‚úÖ Test suite execution

The CLI is primarily a development/testing aid, and the core server functionality works perfectly.
